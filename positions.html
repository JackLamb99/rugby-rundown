                                    The <strong>'Loosehead Prop'</strong> <em>(number 1)</em> and <strong>'Tighthead
                                        Prop'</strong> <em>(number 3)</em>, are the foundations on which a scrum is
                                    built. Usually the most powerful players on the pitch, with the pressure of the
                                    remaining forwards on their backs and necks, their primary responsibility is to
                                    provide stability and strength to anchor the scrum and drive it forwards.
                                </p>
                                <br>
                                <p>
                                    The tighthead is the cornerstone of the scrum, with the aim of pinning down the
                                    opposite loosehead prop and overpowering their pack. While the loosehead is tasked
                                    with trying to get under the opposite tighthead prop and drive them upwards. Scrums
                                    are a battle between opposing props and are won or lost on their backs.

                                    The <strong>'Hooker'</strong> <em>(number 2)</em> is the last, but not least, member
                                    of the <strong>'Front Row'</strong>, positioned between the two props. As per their
                                    name, their primary role during scrums is to hook the ball back using their feet
                                    once it is fed into the scrum by the scrum-half. This action requires precise timing
                                    and technique to ensure possession of the ball or to potentially steal it from the
                                    opposition.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    The hooker plays a vital role during lineouts, as it is their job to accurately and
                                    fairly throw the ball to the best place for their team to catch it. Hookers
                                    typically provide leadership and communication among the forward pack, sometimes
                                    deciding the strategies used to win these set pieces.

                                    The <strong>'Locks'</strong> <em>(numbers 4 & 5)</em>, also known as the
                                    <strong>'Second Row'</strong>, are key players within the forward pack. While they
                                    provide additional power and stability to the scrums, they are instrumental to
                                    winning possession during lineouts. As the tallest players on the pitch, locks are
                                    the primary target for lineout throws due to their height and jumping ability. They
                                    need to have dynamic and accurate technique combined with pinpoint timing to execute
                                    the lineouts properly, or risk giving the opposition the chance to steal possession.

                                    As the largest players on the pitch, locks also play a key role in open play,
                                    expected to be proficient ball carriers and use their size and strength to make hard
                                    yards and gain territory; as well as being aggressive tacklers and enforcers during
                                    defensive plays.

                                <p>
                                    The <strong>'Blindside Flanker'</strong> <em>(number 6)</em> and <strong>'Openside
                                        Flanker'</strong> <em>(number 7)</em> play a critical role in securing
                                    possession and ensuring the opposition cannot breach the defensive line. Generally
                                    speaking, the flankers are the fastest forwards in the team and are tasked with
                                    protecting the ball when their teammates are tackled and ensuring that the
                                    opposition do not gain possession. Usually more physical players that enjoy
                                    confrontation, flankers are great at punching holes in defences and creating gaps
                                    for the backs during open play. Defensively, flankers are expected to have the
                                    highest tackle rate in the team.
                                </p>
                                <br>
                                <p>
                                    The two flankers do not usually bind to the scrum in a fixed position, instead the
                                    openside flanker attaches to whichever side is further from the touchline or closer
                                    to the more open pitch, with the blindside flanker attaching to the opposite side.
                                    Rather than providing power to the scrums, the flankers role is to watch and stop
                                    any move by their opponents to make quick plays between the scrum and the back line.
                                </p>
                                <br>
                                <p>
                                    In lineouts, flankers need to be able to lift the locks up to a catching position,
                                    while also being a third option for catching if required. Flankers use their speed
                                    to move around the line and confuse the opposition, while also being ready to tackle
                                    any players that emerge from the lineout with the ball.

                                    <strong>'8-man'</strong>, is one half of the link between the forwards and the
                                    backs.
                                    Due to the demanding nature of the role, they must be mentally alert, able to
                                    anticipate plays and effectively communicate, as well as having a high level of
                                    fitness and endurance to keep up with every play.

                                    Binding at the back of the scrum, the number 8 is expected to use their weight
                                    behind the locks to drive the pack forward. While they need to watch the opposition
                                    during defensive scrums, their main role is on the offence, as they are the only

                                    deciding between keeping the ball in the scrum, allowing the scrum-half to pick it
                                    up and pass it away, or just running it into contact themselves.

                        their speed, agility and skill handling of the ball, backs are responsible for exploiting space,
                        creating scoring opportunities and launching counterattacks.

                                    The <strong>'Scrum-half'</strong> <em>(number 9)</em> is the other half of the link
                                    between the forwards and the backs, and usually the best passer on the team. Their
                                    primary responsibility lies in orchestrating the team's attack by distributing the
                                    ball quickly and accurately from the ruck or set-piece, sometimes even passing
                                    straight from the floor. This means that a scrum-half needs to make rapid decisions
                                    about where to pass it next, often assessing the field's situation to exploit any
                                    defensive weaknesses or create scoring opportunities. The scrum-half is also
                                    responsible for accurately feeding the ball into scrums.
                                </p>

                                    The scrum-half is also integral to defensive strategies, watching for potential gaps
                                    that the opposition could exploit and organising players accordingly. This means
                                    that while they are small and quick, a scrum-half will typically have great tackling
                                    technique to stop anyone that may slip through the defensive line.

                                    The <strong>'Fly-half'</strong> <em>(number 10)</em> is often regarded as the
                                    playmaker of the team and most influential player on the pitch, responsible for
                                    directing the team's attack by making tactical decisions and executing various
                                    kicking and passing strategies within the back line. They must be cool under
                                    pressure and make quick plays, or risk being targeted by opposition players hoping
                                    to gain possession. Playing as a fly-half is incredibly tricky, as the entire team
                                    is reliant on them to not only make the right decision in each moment, but to
                                    execute their skill precisely and consistently.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    On top of all this, the fly-half is also responsible for kicking penalties,
                                    conversions and drop-goals. This means they must be a consistently accurate kicker,
                                    even while being charged by their opponents.

                                    The <strong>'Inside Centre'</strong> <em>(number 12)</em> and <strong>'Outside
                                        Centre'</strong> <em>(number 13)</em> are the versatile and agile players that
                                    execute the plays made by the fly-half, commonly regarded as the team's main
                                    workhorses. Possessing a combination of speed, strength and skill, centres use
                                    intricate running lines and deceptive footwork to outmanoeuvre their opposition and
                                    break through the defensive line. A centre will have a particularly good eye for
                                    exposing gaps and are some of the most adaptable players on the pitch.

                                    The inside centre is usually the more creative of the two and will often be almost
                                    as good at passing and kicking as the fly-half. While the outside centre will be the
                                    faster of the two, with more elusive footwork and a keen ability to improvise on the
                                    spot.

                                    The <strong>'Left Wing'</strong> <em>(number 11)</em> and <strong>'Right
                                        Wing'</strong> <em>(number 14)</em> are tricky speedsters who statistically
                                    score three times as many tries as any other position. Fast and nimble, they are
                                    positioned on either edge of the pitch and are important players in both attack and
                                    defence. Offensively, wingers are responsible for hunting down kicks, evading
                                    opposition defenders and scoring game-winning tries. They frequently employ
                                    sidesteps, swerves, and rapid acceleration to evade tackles and break through
                                    defensive lines. Wingers are skilled in making low kicks, such as chips and
                                    grubbers, and catching high balls, which they often do mid-air and surrounded by
                                    opposition players.
                                </p>

                                    Wingers also play an essential role defensively, responsible for preventing
                                    opposition wingers and centres from gaining ground, often tackling players into
                                    touch and triggering a lineout. They will often use their catching skills to receive
                                    oncoming kicks and trigger a counter-attack within rapid succession.

                                    The <strong>'Full-back'</strong> <em>(number 15)</em> is the last line of defence,
                                    often standing further away from the rest of the back line and watching over the
                                    entire pitch. They are highly-skilled players in all aspects of the game and are
                                    responsible for marshalling a large area of the field. Defensively, full-backs are
                                    great communicators, informing their teammates about emerging threats and if
                                    opposition players break through the lines, they will have to act as the hero of the
                                    team and make many of the try-saving tackles.

                                    Similar to the wingers, a full-back will receive many of the opposition's kicks,
                                    both high and low, and are then responsible for choosing to either run the ball
                                    forward or kick it back, which can be some of the longest kicks in a rugby game.
