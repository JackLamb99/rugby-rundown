                            The primary objective of rugby is to carry the ball across the opponent's goal line and
                            ground it to score points. Players can advance with the ball in hand, but can only pass
                            (throw the ball) directly across the field (flat), or back in the direction of the passer’s
                            own goal-line (backwards). While kicking the ball forwards is allowed, only the kicker and
                            players positioned behind them at the moment of the kick are allowed to catch it. This is
                            the predominant style of gameplay throughout the 90-minute match and is commonly referred to
                            as ‘open play’.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A ‘knock-on’ occurs when a player mishandles ball and it travels forward off their hand or
                            arm, hitting the ground or another player. The same ruling applies if a player drops the
                            ball forward when being tackled or when a player passes the ball to a teammate that is
                            further ahead than them, known as a ‘forward pass’. These infractions are punishable by a
                            scrum being awarded to the opposition, therefore a turnover of possession.

                            Points can be scored through various means, the most common being a try, where a player
                            forced the ball to the ground over the opponent’s goal line, earning five points.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Following a try, a conversion can be attempted for two additional points by kicking the ball
                            over the crossbar (between the posts) from a place in line with where the try was
                            scored.

                        <p>
                            Three points can be gained from a drop goal, when a player drops the ball onto the ground
                            and kicks it over the crossbar in open play, or by choosing to kick the ball over the
                            crossbar when awarded a penalty.

                            A tackle is used by the defending team to stop their opposition from advancing, but only the
                            ball carrier can be tackled. A tackle occurs when the ball carrier is held by one or more
                            opponents and is brought to the ground. As tackling can be unsafe when not performed
                            properly, so rules are in place to protect all players involved. Players must not tackle an
                            opponent above the line of the shoulders, this is called a ‘high tackle’ and can incur heavy
                            sanctions.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To maintain the continuity of the game, the ball carrier must release the ball immediately
                            after the tackle, typically by presenting it as far away from the opposition as possible.
                            The tackler must release the ball carrier and, when possible, both players must roll away
                            from the ball. This allows other players to come in and contest for the ball, known as a
                            ‘ruck’.

                        <p>
                            A ’ruck’ is formed if the ball is on the ground and one or more players from each team who
                            are on their feet close around it. Players must not handle the ball in the ruck, and must
                            use their feet to move the ball or drive over it so that it emerges at the team’s hindmost
                            foot, at which point it can be picked up. Rucks can involve as many or as few players as
                            required, but each must join the ruck from behind, entering from the side will incur a
                            penalty.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A ’maul’ occurs when three or more players, including the ball carrier and at least one
                            other player from either side, are in contact together. What makes the maul different to the
                            ruck is that the ball is not on the ground but in hand. Either side can use this opportunity
                            to gain territory by driving the maul towards their opponent’s goal line. The ball can be
                            handed backwards between the players in the maul and passed out of it if needed. Similar to
                            a ruck, mauls can involve as many players as required, but they must join from behind.

                        <p>
                            In rugby union, the offside rule regulates the positioning of players relative to the ball
                            and their teammates. When a player is offside, they are in a position that gives them an
                            unfair advantage or impedes opponents. In general, players must stay behind the ball carrier
                            or behind the ball when it's on the ground.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            During set pieces like scrums, lineouts, and rucks, players must stay behind the hindmost
                            foot of their own team. If they are ahead of these positions, they are offside. If the team
                            involved in a maul or scrum are able to gain territory by driving up the field, the offside
                            line moves forward with them, always on the back foot of the hindmost player. Additionally,
                            players are not offside if they are behind the ball when it is kicked by a teammate. While
                            it’s not necessarily an offence to be in an offside position, if the player then interferes
                            with play in any way, referees can award a penalty to the opposing team.

                            The ‘scrum’ serves as a means of restarting play following minor infractions or when the
                            ball
                            becomes unplayable in a ruck or maul. Each team forms an eight-player ‘pack’ by linking arms
                            and shoulders, with the front three known as the ‘front row’. The scrum engages when the
                            heads of the front rows interlock, and the scrum-half throws the ball into the tunnel
                            between packs. The opposing hookers compete for possession by ‘hooking’ it back with their
                            feet.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The winner of the scrum can choose to keep the ball on the ground and attempt to gain
                            territory by driving the opposition down the field, or the scrum-half can collect the ball
                            from the back of the scrum and pass it to the rest of the team to resume open play.

                        <p>If the ball goes off the field at the side, known as going into ‘touch’, a lineout is used to
                            restart play. The ‘forwards’ assemble in two lines, perpendicular to the touchline and one
                            metre apart. The hooker then throws the ball down the corridor between the two lines,
                            typically at a height requiring the receiver to be ‘lifted’ by their teammates.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The team that throws the ball can gain the advantage by deciding ahead of time which player
                            will be lifted to receive the throw, leaving the opposing players little time to react. As
                            the opposition cannot touch the catcher whist they are in the air, they can choose to either
                            pass the ball to the ‘backs’ to resume open play, or keep hold of it as they come to the
                            ground and form a maul.
