                            The primary objective of rugby is to carry the ball across the opponent's goal line and
                            ground it to score points. Players can advance with the ball in hand, but can only pass
                            <em>(throw the ball)</em> directly across the field <em>(flat)</em>, or back in the
                            direction of the passer's own goal line <em>(backwards)</em>. While kicking the ball
                            forwards is allowed, only the kicker and players positioned behind them at the moment of
                            the kick are allowed to catch it. This is the predominant style of gameplay throughout
                            the 90-minute match and is commonly referred to as <strong>'Open Play'</strong>.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            A <strong>'Knock-on'</strong> occurs when a player mishandles the ball and it travels
                            forward off their hand or arm, hitting the ground or another player. The same ruling applies
                            if a player drops the ball forward when being tackled or when a player passes the ball to a
                            teammate that is further ahead than them, known as a <strong>'Forward Pass'</strong>. These
                            infractions are punishable by a scrum being awarded to the opposition, therefore a turnover
                            of possession.

                            Points can be scored through various means, the most common being a <strong>'Try'</strong>,
                            where a player forces the ball to the ground over the opponent's goal line, <em>earning five
                                points</em>.

                            Following a try, a <strong>'Conversion'</strong> can be attempted for <em>two additional
                                points</em> by kicking the ball over the crossbar <em>(between the posts)</em> from a
                            place in line with where the try was scored.

                            <em>Three points</em> can be gained from a <strong>'Drop-goal'</strong>, when a player drops
                            the ball onto the ground and kicks it over the crossbar in open play, or by choosing to kick
                            the ball over the crossbar when awarded a penalty.

                            <strong>'Tackling'</strong> is used by the defending team to stop their opposition from
                            advancing, but <em>only the ball-carrier</em> can be tackled. A tackle occurs when the
                            ball-carrier is held by one or more opponents and is brought to the ground. Tackling can be
                            unsafe when not performed properly, so rules are in place to protect all players involved.
                            Players <em>must not</em> tackle an opponent above the line of the shoulders, this is called
                            a <strong>'High Tackle'</strong> and can incur <em>heavy sanctions</em>.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            To maintain the continuity of the game, the ball-carrier must release the ball immediately
                            after the tackle, typically by presenting it as far away from the opposition as possible.
                            The tackler must release the ball-carrier and, when possible, both players must roll away
                            from the ball. This allows other players to come in and contest for the ball, known as a
                            <strong>'Ruck'</strong>.

                            A <strong>'Ruck'</strong> is formed if the ball is on the ground and one or more players
                            from each team who are on their feet close around it. Players <em>must not</em> handle the
                            ball in the ruck, and must use their feet to move the ball or drive over it so that it
                            emerges at the team's hindmost foot, at which point it can be picked up. Rucks can involve
                            as many or as few players as required, but each must join the ruck from behind, entering
                            from the side will <em>incur a penalty</em>.

                        <p>
                            A <strong>'Maul'</strong> occurs when three or more players, including the ball carrier and
                            at least one other player from either side, are in contact together. What makes a maul
                            different to a ruck is that the ball is not on the ground, but <em>in a standing player's
                                hands</em>. Either side can use this opportunity to gain territory by driving the maul
                            towards their opponent's goal line. The ball can be handed backwards between the players in
                            the maul and passed out of it if needed. Similar to a ruck, mauls can involve as many
                            players as required, but they <em>must join from behind</em>.

                        <p>
                            In Rugby Union, the <strong>'Offside'</strong> rule regulates the positioning of players
                            relative to the ball and their teammates. When a player is offside, they are in a position
                            that gives them an unfair advantage or impedes opponents. In general, players <em>must stay
                                behind</em> the ball carrier or behind the ball when it's on the ground.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            During <strong>'Set Pieces'</strong>, like scrums and lineouts, players <em>must stay
                                behind</em> the hindmost foot of their own team. If they are ahead of these positions,
                            they are offside. If the team involved in a maul or scrum are able to gain territory by
                            driving up the field, the offside line moves forward with them, always on the back foot of
                            the hindmost player. Additionally, players are not offside if they are behind the ball when
                            it is kicked by a teammate. While it's not necessarily an offence to be in an offside
                            position, if the player then interferes with play in any way, referees can award a penalty
                            to the opposing team.

                            The <strong>'Scrum'</strong> serves as a means of restarting play following minor
                            infractions or when the ball becomes <em>unplayable</em> in a ruck or maul. Each team forms
                            an eight-player <strong>'Pack'</strong> by linking arms and shoulders, with the front three
                            known as the <strong>'Front Row'</strong>. The scrum engages when the heads of the opposing
                            front rows interlock, and the <em>scrum-half</em> throws the ball into the tunnel between
                            packs. The opposing <em>hookers</em> compete for possession by <em>hooking</em> it back with
                            their feet.

                            The winner of the scrum can choose to keep the ball on the ground and attempt to gain
                            territory by driving the opposition down the field, or the scrum-half can collect the
                            ball from the back of the scrum and pass it to the rest of the team to resume open play.

                        <p>
                            If the ball goes off the field at the side, known as <em>going into touch</em>, a
                            <strong>'Lineout'</strong> is used to restart play. The <em>forwards</em> assemble in two
                            lines, perpendicular to the touchline and one metre apart. The <em>hooker</em> then throws
                            the ball down the corridor between the two lines, typically at a height requiring the
                            receiver to be <em>lifted</em> by their teammates.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            The team that throws the ball can gain the advantage by deciding ahead of time which player
                            will be lifted to receive the throw, leaving the opposing players little time to react. As
                            the opposition cannot touch the catcher whist they are in the air, they can choose to either
                            pass the ball to the <em>scrum-half</em> to resume open play, or keep hold of it as they
                            come to the ground and form a maul.
